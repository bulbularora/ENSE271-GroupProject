# ENSE271-Project
Design and Development a New Website for IABC(Regina)

## Team: Geonosians
*Bulbul Arora*    *Li Pan*  *Xia Hua* 

## Summarized project background & business need/opportunity
1. Main users : members, admins . 
2. The IABC needs the website to be simple to users.  
3. Easy navigation on the website so people can look for the information faster and more easily. 
4. Attaching more members join.
5. Itâ€™s better to build a new function for membership payment. 
6. Have their own content which is different from their international site(share IABC regina specific things) -- career page, job seeker, events
7. Redirect members to the international website for duplicate information(so the board has less content to renew or manage). Also, saves the board members time.
8. Set up 2-way communication from the board to the members and vice versa( blogs, presentations)
9. Let members easily post events, news,jobs.
10. A sign up/ sign in option where members can easily track their events, accreditations etc.
