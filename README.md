Design and Development a New Website for IABC(Regina)

## About IABC
ABC/Regina proudly represents communication professionals based in Regina, Saskatchewan and the surrounding area. Our members apply their expertise and skills in strategic communications, crisis management, public relations, media relations, social media, marketing, and corporate communication across all sectors. Connecting through learning, networking, and mentoring opportunities, our organization promotes ethical business communication standards, inspires a passion for learning and helps our members achieve communications excellence in their daily work. We are part of IABC, a global network of communication leaders operating in 70 countries.

IABC Regina is governed by an annually elected slate of directors nominated from the membership. The main focus of the Board is to create opportunities for fellow members to network, learn, and grow. 

IABC/Regina is committed to providing professional development opportunities year-round. All professional development workshops, luncheons, and networking sessions hosted by IABC/Regina focus on topics that are relevant to our chapter members. Increasingly, IABC is offering virtual professional development sessions and partnering with neighbouring chapters (particularly IABC/Saskatoon) to provide expanded networking opportunities. The IABC/Regina website also provides organizations with a platform to advertise career opportunities within Regina and the surrounding area, and this feature is highly valued by employers and members alike.
